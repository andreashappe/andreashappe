### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Andreas, I am a software developer gone pen-tester.

ðŸ”­ðŸŒ±ðŸ‘¯ I am currently working on using [Offensive AI for Security](https://github.com/ipa-lab/hackingBuddyGPT) as par tof my phd thesis

#### About me

- Got my master degree in Software Engineering from the Technical University of Vienna, Austria
- After some years of software development slowly turned into a penetration-tester, focusing upon web security
- Taught multiple web security classes at the University of Applied Sciences Vienna / Technikum Wien
- Over time became OWASP Leader (and Co-Leader) of multiple projects, e.g., OWASP Chapter Vienna, [OWASP Chapter Klagenfurt](https://github.com/OWASP/www-chapter-klagenfurt), [OWASP Proactive Security Controls](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-proactive-controls).
- While at the Austrian Institute of Technology, I initially worked on [Quantum Key Distribution networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Communication_based_on_Quantum_Cryptography) (and somehow am one of many co-authors of a paper with a Nobel Prize Lectaurate, funny world), later on [Secret-Sharing in the cloud](https://github.com/Archistar) as well as on [identity management](https://credential.eu/).
